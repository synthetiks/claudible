# Third-Party Licenses

Claudible is licensed under the MIT License (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). The distributed application
additionally **bundles** the following third-party components, whose licenses are reproduced below in full as
their terms require. Each is redistributed unmodified.

The components in Part A are shipped inside the installer (under `resources/app/node_modules/`). The runtime
framework (Electron, and the Chromium and Node.js it embeds) ships its own license files inside the packaged
application. Part B lists components that Claudible **fetches at setup time from their upstream projects** —
they are downloaded onto the end user's machine and are **not** redistributed inside Claudible's installer;
they are listed here for transparency, and each remains governed by its own upstream license.

### Electron (and embedded Chromium / Node.js) — MIT License

The Electron runtime is redistributed as part of the packaged application. Electron ships its own license
file (`LICENSE`), and the license notices for the Chromium and Node.js components it embeds, inside the
packaged application (e.g. `LICENSE`, `LICENSES.chromium.html`) as produced by `electron-builder`. Electron
itself is under the MIT License, © GitHub Inc. and Electron contributors.

## Part B — Fetched at setup time (not bundled in the installer)

These are downloaded from their upstream projects by `setup/setup.sh`, `wsl/provision.sh`, and the Windows
provisioning scripts when you install the voice services or missing dependencies. They are installed onto your
machine directly from upstream and are **not** redistributed inside Claudible's installer. Each is governed by
its own license:

| Component | License | Upstream |
|---|---|---|
| whisper.cpp | MIT | https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp |
| Kokoro-FastAPI | Apache-2.0 | https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI |
| uv | MIT / Apache-2.0 | https://github.com/astral-sh/uv |
| cloudflared | Apache-2.0 | https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared |

All four are permissively licensed and compatible with Claudible's MIT distribution. Because they are fetched
by the end user from upstream rather than redistributed by Claudible, their attribution obligations attach to
those upstream distributions; they are listed here for transparency.
